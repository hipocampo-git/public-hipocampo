We were the Menace - not in disguise, but stone-obvious drug abusers, with a __________ (adverb) cranked-up act that we intended to push all the way to the limit...not to prove any final, sociological point, and not event as a conscious mockery: It was mainly a matter of life-style, a sense of obligation and even duty.

      hint: '“And this is the evil that heresy inflicts on the Christian people, ________ (present participle) ideas and inciting all to become inquisitors to their personal benefit. For what I was to see at the abbey would make me think that it is often inquisitors who create heretics. And not only in the sense that they imagine heretics where these do not exist, but also that inquisitors repress the heretical putrefaction so vehemently that many are driven to share in it, in their hatred for the judges. Truly, a circle conceived by the Devil. God preserve us.”\n― Umberto Eco, The Name of the Rose',
